# what is a "telodigrade"??

"telodigrade" is a combination of two fascinations i have to remind me of the evidence that there is still much to learn about our existence and universe.

## TELOmeres + tardiGRADEs

telomeres are the ends of our chromosomal chain that begin to fray as we age.  our dna begin to lose thier ability to express themselves in our physical being.  there are many things we can do to slow, and sometimes restore telomere length with healthier lifestyle choices.  i expect someday we will crack the code to not just living longer lives, but also quality lives.

tardigrades, or "water bears", are mysterious creatures that have survived the earths cataclysmic events (extreme heat, and cold, and radiation).  the are know to live hundreds of years in hibernation, and are restored to life with moisture.  some theorize that life may be transferred to other worlds through such a robust life form.
