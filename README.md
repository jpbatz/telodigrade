# what is a "telograde"???

"telodigrade" is a combination of two fascinations i have to remind me of the evidence that there is still much to learn about our existence and universe.

## TELOmere + tarDIGRADE

telomeres are the ends of our chromosomal chain that begin to fray as we age.  our dna begin to lose thier ability to fully express themselves in our physical being.  there are many things we can do to slow, and sometimes restore telomere length with intelligent lifestyle choices such as quality sleep, stress regulators (such as some forms of meditation), consumption of primarily life promoting foods.  i expect someday we will crack the code to not just living longer lives, but also quality lives.

tardigrades, or "water bears", are mysterious creatures that have survived the earths cataclysmic events (extreme heat, cold, and radiation).  the are know to live hundreds of years in hibernation, and are restored to life with moisture.  some theorize that life may be transferred to other worlds through such a robust life form.

as we extend life, may we also expand the qulality of life for all and all that we have the privilege and responsibility to be good stewards of.  may those lives be lived intentionally, consciously, and as the ultimate result - compassionatley toward all beings and lifeforms.
